                                Hello! My name is Justin and I'm a UW 
                                graduate student that majored in Science, Technology, 
                                and Society. While minored in Computer Science and 
                                Software Engineering. I have always had a strong passion for
                                technology and problem-solving, which has shaped my educational
                                and career goals. My aim is to become a successful software 
                                engineer, building innovative programs and solutions that 
                                will have a significant impact on both the business world 
                                and the people who use them. I strive to excel in my 
                                academic pursuits and constantly challenge myself to reach 
                                new heights, both personally and professionally. One of 
                                my core motivations is to make a living that not only 
                                sustains me but also allows me to give back to my family, 
                                who have supported me throughout my journey.
                            </p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>
                                My academic accomplishments include making the Dean's 
                                List at the University of Washington Bothell, where 
                                I have maintained an above-average GPA of 3.6. This 
                                recognition is a testament to my commitment to 
                                excellence and my determination to succeed. The 
                                journey to this point has required a lot of hard work, 
                                discipline, and time management, especially as I balanced 
                                my academic responsibilities with other activities and 
                                work experiences. This recognition has only motivated me 
                                further to push the limits of what I can achieve and 
                                contribute to the tech world.
                            </p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>
                                Looking ahead, I am excited about the future and the 
                                opportunities that lie before me in the field of software 
                                engineering. I know that my past experiences, both my 
                                successes and the challenges I’ve faced, have equipped me 
                                with the skills and mindset necessary to achieve my goals. 
                                Whether it’s pushing through difficult coursework, working 
                                on complex projects, or helping others through leadership 
                                roles, I am committed to continuously learning, improving, 
                                and making a positive impact in whatever I do. My journey 
                                is far from over, and I am confident that with 
                                determination, hard work, and a desire to make a 
                                difference, I will be able to achieve my goals and give 
                                back to the people and communities that have supported 
                                me along the way.
